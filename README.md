 The [DES](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/hormones/des-fact-sheet) encryption algorithm was implemented in the CBC mode. <br />
The algorithm encrypts file_a and outputs file_b. By decrypting file_b, you can get file_a. <br />
The program is developed with unit tests, but without an interface. <br />
[Algorithm implementation](Lab2/encrypt_algorithm), [tests](Lab2/tests)
